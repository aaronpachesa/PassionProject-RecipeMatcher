# Passion Project

## RecipeMatchers

is an iOS app that acts as the matchmaker between your three minimum available ingredients in your refrigerators with the collections of quick and easy recipes to help your family cut costs, make the time for healthier dinner, and it also promotes  environmental sustainability.


## Further development:
1. Users can select their favorites recipe and put them into their collections.
1. Users can add notes into their favorited recipes to adjust the ingredients to their tastebuds.
